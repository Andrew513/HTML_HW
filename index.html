                            21 is the second studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on 24 January 2011[1] in Europe and on 22 February 
                            2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 
                            21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and 
                            Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during the North American leg of her 2008–09 tour An Evening with Adele. 
                            Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the 
                            confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, introspection, and forgiveness.
